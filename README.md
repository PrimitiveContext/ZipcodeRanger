# ZipcodeRanger

**ZipcodeRanger** is a Python-based toolset for analyzing and visualizing ZIP code coverage in the United States. The project includes functionality to compute "parent ZIP codes" based on population coverage within a given radius and to visualize these regions using maps.

## Features

- **Parent ZIP Code Selection**: Identify ZIP codes that maximize population coverage within a specified radius.
- **Population Analysis**: Compute total population and associated child ZIP codes within coverage regions.
- **Interactive Mapping**: Generate maps of selected parent ZIP codes and their coverage areas.
- **Custom Radius**: Support for multiple radius values to analyze different coverage scales.

## Repository Structure

- `uszips.csv`: Dataset containing ZIP code details such as latitude, longitude, population, density, and city/state names.
- `GetParentZips.py`: Core script for analyzing population coverage and selecting parent ZIP codes.
- `PlotParentZips.py`: Visualization script to generate maps of parent ZIP codes and their coverage areas.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tqdm`
  - `cartopy`

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib tqdm cartopy
```

### Usage

#### Step 1: Analyzing Coverage
Use `GetParentZips.py` to compute parent ZIP codes for a specified radius.

```bash
python GetParentZips.py
```

1. Ensure `uszips.csv` is present in the same directory as the script.
2. Enter the desired radius (or multiple radii) in miles when prompted.

The script generates:
- A CSV file listing parent ZIP codes, their coverage, and associated child ZIP codes.
- A plot showing the cumulative population coverage curve for the computed parent ZIP codes.

#### Step 2: Visualizing Coverage
Use `PlotParentZips.py` to visualize the computed parent ZIP codes and their coverage areas on a map.

```bash
python PlotParentZips.py <ParentZipsCSV>
```

1. Replace `<ParentZipsCSV>` with the filename of the CSV generated by `GetParentZips.py`.
2. Specify the number of parent ZIP codes to display on the map when prompted.

The script generates:
- A PNG map highlighting the coverage areas of the selected parent ZIP codes.

### Example Workflow

1. Run `GetParentZips.py` and provide a radius of `10` miles:
   ```bash
   python GetParentZips.py
   ```
   Input: `10`

   Output:
   - `10Miles_100ParentZips.csv`: Contains parent ZIP code details for a 10-mile radius.
   - `Curve_10Miles_100ParentZips.png`: Cumulative population coverage curve.

2. Visualize the coverage:
   ```bash
   python PlotParentZips.py 10Miles_100ParentZips.csv
   ```

   Output:
   - `10Miles_100ParentZips.png`: Map of top parent ZIP codes and their coverage areas.

### Data Description

The `uszips.csv` dataset includes the following fields:
- `zip`: ZIP code
- `lat`: Latitude
- `lng`: Longitude
- `city`: City name
- `state_name`: State name
- `population`: Population count
- `density`: Population density
- `population_x_density`: Combined metric for ranking

### Output Files

- **Parent ZIP Code CSV**: Lists parent ZIP codes, associated child ZIP codes, and total population coverage.
- **Population Coverage Plot**: Line plot showing cumulative population coverage for selected parent ZIP codes.
- **Coverage Map**: PNG map of parent ZIP code coverage areas.
